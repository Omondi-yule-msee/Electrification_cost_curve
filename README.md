- gep_onsset_modified.py: modified source code for the OnSSET model sourced from the Global electrification platform
- gep_runner.py: modifed script that runs the gep_onsset.py 
- scenario_specs_input.xlsx modified input file containing inputs used in the gep_runner script
- sample_output: The directory shows the representative results from the electrification model: 
  - ng-1-0_0_0_0_0_0.csv (sample of full results)
  - ng-1-0_0_0_0_0_0_summary.csv (sample of summary results)

Guidelines on how to use the model can be found on the Global electrification platform: https://gep-onsset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Scenario%20run.html
